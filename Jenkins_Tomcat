Integrate jenkins project with tomcat
Here, jenkins pull the code from GitHub, Build it using maven. 
After that, Jenkins get the war file (webapp.war) and deploy it in webapps (Tomcat server). 

To do that: I need:

A code in GitHub that has a POM file which generates war file.
A server with Tomcat and java installed and configured.
A Server with these tools installed and configured:
	- A CI/CD tool :like ”jenkins”  
- A SCM (Source Control Management) tool: like “git”. 
 	- A project management tool : like “maven”
- As plugins: “Git plugin”to integrate git with jenkins.

Now , give access to jenkins to the tomcat server. 
In manage credentials, add the credentials. In kind, choose username and password which are deployer. 

 Finally, create a maven job
 Give to jenkins the git URL of the code; precise the branch to build; 
 Set up Poll SCM to check whether changes were made (i.e. new commits) 
 Add the goals: clean install package in the job.
 and builds the project if new commits where pushed since the last build, 
 
In post build actions, look for deploy war/ear to a container and fill out (**/*.war)
choose tomcat 8, give credentials. Then paste URL of the server tomcat.
