Integrate jenkins project with maven

Here, the developers push the code to GitHub. Jenkins pull that code from the registry, 
and build it using maven. The code has to have a POM (project object model) file.


Prerequisite:
A Linux Server with these tools installed and configured:
- A CI/CD tool: Jenkins to enable  build, test, and deploy the software, 
install “java” because jenkins is  written entirely in Java. Then tell jenkins where is java in the system. 
So set up JAVA_HOME in bash_profile. 
Set up also the name and path in global tool configuration on Console jenkins.

- A SCM tool (Source Control Management): GIT that instructs Jenkins to obtain code from GitHub.
Set up the name and path in global tool configuration on Console jenkins..

  - A project management tool: Maven  that allows  to create projects, dependency, and documentation using Project Object Model. 
 Install “maven” in opt directory, go back to home directory to give maven’s path, M2_HOME, to jenkins in bash_profile. 
 Set up the name and path in global tool configuration.

- As plugins, I install” Git plugin”to integrate git with jenkins.
- The code in Github with the pom file.





Now, I can create a maven job. 
Give to jenkins the git URL of the code and the goals: clean install package .
Precise the branch to build; set up Poll SCM to check whether changes were made (i.e. new commits) 
and builds the project if new commits where pushed since the last build.
