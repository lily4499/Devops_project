Jenkins Ansible Integration : Run Ansible playbook from jenkins pipeline job 
Here, jenkins pull the code from the registry, and deploy the code to the targets servers and execute the code using ansible playbook. 
The code has to have a playbook file with instruction for the tasks and a inventory created with the ip address of the target server)  
.
To do that, I need :

A Server with these tools installed and configured :
	  - A CI/CD tool :like ”jenkins” which is written in “java” 
    - A SCM (Source Control Management) tool: like “git”. 
	  - Ansible to deploy tasks to the targets servers
As plugins: 
“Git plugin”to integrate git with jenkins.
“Ansible plugin” Invoke ansible Ad-Hoc commands and playbooks.

Now , create a new job pipeline
In the script ; First clone ansible repository. 
Then  execute ansible playbook.
to do that, go to pipeline syntax, on sample step,
choose ansiblePlaybook: invoke an ansible playbook and file out the information 
with the name of ansible that I give in global tool configuration, 
of the playbook file and of the inventory file. 
Also, add credentials to enable jenkins to connect with the target server by ssh username with private key; 
After that, click on generate pipeline, copy and paste in the script.
