    - Choose “Role-Based Strategy” in manage jenkins > Configure Global Security
    - Create users in Manage jenkins > Manage Users
    - Create a new global role in Manage jenkins  > “Manage and Assign Roles” that will be 	
    applicable for all the objects in the jenkins
    
    - Create a new item roles  in Manage jenkins > “Manage and Assign Roles 
    that can be applied to only certain projects (i.e jobs) that match a certain pattern.
    
    - Assign user to the new group in “Manage Jenkins” > “Manage and Assign Roles” 
    Add user created and click on the “check-box” corresponding to the project-role name for this user,
    which will assign that particular role to user.
