Jenkins console:

    - Install “Role-based Authorization Strategy” in manage jenkins >> manage plugins
    - Choose “Role-Based Strategy” in manage jenkins >> Configure Global Security
    - Create users in Manage jenkins >> Manage Users
    - Create a new global role in Manage jenkins  >> “Manage and Assign Roles” that will be 	
    applicable for all the objects in the jenkins.
            For example, create “admin” role, “developer” role, “devops” role, etc here.
          Once add a global role (for example: developer), then select the permissions that we 		
          want to assign for that particular global role.
    
    - Create a new item roles  in Manage jenkins >> “Manage and Assign Roles 
    that can be 	applied to only certain projects (i.e jobs) that match a certain pattern. 
          For example, create a project role called “web”,which will apply only to all the projects 
          (i.e 	jenkins jobs) that starts with the keyword “web*” (this is the pattern) .
          add “(?i)” to the pattern for case insensitive. For example (?i)web* will match jobs 	
          starting with both “web” and “Web”.
          After creating the roles (either global role, or project role) with appropriate permissions, 	
          the next step is to assign users to this role.
    
    - Assign user to the new group in “Manage Jenkins” >> “Manage and Assign Roles” 
    Add user created and click on the “check-box” corresponding to the project-role name for 	this user,
    which will assign that particular role to user.
    In this case, I’ve added “web” Project roles to a user called Lisa. the pattern we gave was “web*”. 	
    So, Lisa will have access to any Jenkins project that has the word “web” in the name.
