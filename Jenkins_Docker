Integrate jenkins project with docker

Here, the developers push the code to GitHub. 
jenkins pull that code from the registry, and build a docker image and push that to docker registry. 



To do that: we need:
- A Server with :
  Jenkins and docker installed and configured;
  Git installed and  path set up on server and console Jenkins
  
- Code in Github with a Dockerfile to build docker image. 

- As plugins: 
”Cloudbees Docker Build and Publish ” to enable building Dockerfile based project.
“Git plugin”to integrate git with jenkins.
          
          

Now , give access to jenkins to the docker registry. 
In manage credentials, add the credentials. In kind, choose username and password. 

 Finally, create a freestyle job
Give to jenkins the git URL of my code; precise the branch to build; 
set up Poll SCM to check whether changes were made (i.e. new commits) and builds the project if new commits where pushed since the last build.  
In add post build, click on docker build and publish to give jenkins login information and also tag our repository.
